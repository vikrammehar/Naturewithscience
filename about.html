                        <p class="card-text mx-2">
                            It’s easy to think nature will always be with us. But even in my lifetime, birds like
                            starlings and house sparrows have declined so much they’re now listed as endangered.

                            In fact, nature is faring worse in the UK than in most other countries. The latest State of
                            Nature report shows that over half our wild species – plants, insects, birds, mammals – are
                            in decline.
                            First, how was your last holiday? Did you spend any time in nature? Shut your eyes and see
                            if you can recall how you feel about the last time you spent time in nature.

                            What about your normal busy day away from stunning views, beaches and sunsets? Does your
                            daily routine give you any experiences of nature?

                            Perhaps you don't have the time to notice the birds calling, the bees buzzing and to enjoy
                            the colours of the changing seasons in a local park, even in your own street.

                            If you’re not getting enough nature you're not alone.

                            Seven out of 10 people admit they’re losing touch with nature. And more than a third of
                            parents admit they could not teach their own children about British wildlife.

                            Pressures of daily life mean we’re increasingly detached from nature even though nature in
                            many forms is there for us. Yes, like love, nature is all around – and it’s free.

                            Even watching wildlife programmes online or on the TV costs — but it’s still no substitute
                            for experiencing nature direct. You don’t have to go on safari, to the Amazon rainforest or
                            to the Grand Canyon for fulfilling experiences of nature.

                            Great as those places are, nature is also on our doorstep all year round. Even in winter.
                            Just add your own curiosity, a chunk of attention span and a dollop of patience.
                            What do people think about the importance of nature?

                            Asked to give their favourite views, Britons tend to put natural heritage before buildings
                            and cityscapes. Yes, Brits favour views of Wales’ Gower Peninsula and Northern Ireland’s
                            Mountains of Mourne over sights like Waterloo Bridge, Blackpool Tower and Stonehenge.

                            Not even the poet William Wordsworth put people off voting for the “long, stern and
                            desolate" views of Cumbria’s Wastwater and its scree slopes to the Scafell peaks as
                            Britain’s favourite.

                            Dramatic landscapes fire our imagination, fill our hearts and put our lives into
                            perspective. But everyday experiences of nature give us a boost too. It’s like having our
                            very own free Natural Health Service.
                            Wild child: importance of nature to children

                            Children especially have a natural affinity with nature. Evidence is growing of how regular
                            contact with nature boosts new born children’s healthy development, supports their physical
                            and mental health and instils abilities to assess risk as they grow. It even underpins their
                            informal learning and academic achievement. </p>

                            For children and adults alike, daily contact with nature is linked to better health, less
                            stress, better mood, reduced obesity –

                            This affinity tends to get knocked out of them as they grow. They come under pressure to put
                            away childish things in favour of passing exams and getting a "proper job".

                            Along with digital distractions and legitimate fears about playing outdoors, the pressures
                            are removing children from nature before our very eyes. Who can blame them for thinking an
                            apple is a gadget first and a fruit second?

                            Yet for children and adults alike, daily contact with nature – being in green, open space,
                            near healthy rivers, exploring nature’s colours, sounds, tones and textures — is linked to
                            better health, less stress, better mood, reduced obesity. That’s already an amazing list of
                            features no other product can ever match. </p>

                        <p class="card-text mx-2">What about the value of the world’s natural ecosystem services? A first
                            estimate was put at an average $33 trillion annually – that’s 12 noughts or a million
                            million.

                            More to the point, this value of nature is nearly twice global GNP of $18 trillion.

                            The figures will have changed since these first calculations but it underlines the obvious -
                            that nature is both invaluable and priceless. Put another way, if we’re silly enough to let
                            nature decline can we afford to put it back? Three guesses.

                            That matters when one considers another big global study of the state of nature and its
                            value. The UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment found that approximately two-thirds of the
                            world’s natural ecosystems are degraded or being used in irresponsible, unsustainable ways.
                            “Every year we lose three to five trillion dollars’ worth of natural capital, roughly
                            equivalent to the amount of money we lost in the financial crisis of 2008–2009”, the report
                            said. Every year. Nature in our hands

                            Friends of the Earth has a 45-year track record of working with people to protect nature.
                            There are plenty of ways to support our nature work, including signing our petition to
                            double tree cover in the UK, or donating today. Thank you.</p>
